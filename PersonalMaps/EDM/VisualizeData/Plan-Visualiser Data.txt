B1: (EDM - Visualiser Data)
    1: Implement sorting method for 3 value sets, using test objects
        a: Create constructor framework
    2: Sort best/worst toggles, decide what best/worst even means
    3: calculate and display mean + median of each column
    4: Async import excel data, or store in folder
        a: tie in with constructor framework, class to objects, array?
        b: nest objects and async calculate each? (Dubious)
    5: Improve presentation
B1: Optionals
    1: Re-do sort to not use built-in .sort method
        a: research efficiency
    2: Graphs built from data set, different for each column
